                                    >This self-portrait was one of about 32 produced over a 10-year period, and these
                                    were an important part of his work as a painter. he painted himself because he often
                                    lacked the money to pay for models. He took the painting with him to
                                    Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he showed it to Dr. Paul Gachet, who thought it
                                    was "absolutely fanatical". Art historians are divided as to whether this painting
                                    or Self-portrait without beard is Van Gogh's final self-portrait. Art historians
                                    Ingo F. Walther and Jan Hulsker consider this to be the last, with Hulsker
                                    considering that it was painted in Arles following Van Gogh's admission to hospital
                                    after mutilating his ear, while Ronald Pickvance thinks Self-portrait without beard
                                    was the later painting.</span

                                    >Van Gogh sent the picture to his younger brother, the art dealer Theo; an
                                    accompanying letter read: "You will need to study for a time. I hope you will notice
                                    that my facial expressions have become much calmer, although my eyes have the same
                                    insecure look as before, or so it appears to me." Walther and Rainer Metzger
                                    consider that "the picture is not a pretty pose nor a realistic record. one that has
                                    seen too much jeopardy, too much turmoil, to be able to keep its agitation and
                                    trembling under control." According to Beckett the dissolving colours and same time
                                    turbulent patterns signal a feeling of strain and pressure, symbolising the artist's
                                    state of mind, which is under a mental, physical and emotional pressure. The Musée
                                    d'Orsay in Paris, who obtained the picture in 1986, noted that "the model's
                                    immobility contrasts with the undulating hair and beard, echoed and amplified in the
                                    hallucinatory arabesques of the background."</span

                                <strong>V</strong>incent van Gogh grew up in the southern Netherlands, where his father
                                was a minister. After seven years at a commercial art firm, Van Gogh’s desire to help
                                humanity led him to become a teacher, preacher, and missionary—yet without success.
                                Working as a missionary among coal miners in Belgium, he had begun to draw in earnest;
                                finally, dismissed by church authorities in 1880, he found his vocation in art.
                            </span>
                            <span>
                                Van Gogh’s earliest paintings were earth-toned scenes of nature and peasants, but he
                                became increasingly influenced by Japanese prints and the work of the impressionists in
                                France. In 1886 he arrived in Paris, where his real formation as a painter began. Under
                                the influence of Camille Pissarro, Van Gogh brightened his somber palette and juxtaposed
                                complementary colors for luminous effect. Younger artists like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec
                                and Paul Gauguin prompted him to use color symbolically and for its emotional resonance.
                            </span>
                            <span>
                                Although stimulated by the city’s artistic environment, Van Gogh found life in Paris
                                physically exhausting and moved in early 1888 to Arles. He hoped Provence’s warm climate
                                would relax him and that the brilliant colors and strong light of the south would
                                provide inspiration for his art. Working feverishly, Van Gogh pushed his style to
                                greater expression with intense, energetic brushwork and saturated, complementary
                                colors. Yet his densely painted canvases remained connected to nature—their colors and
                                rhythmic surfaces communicate the spiritual power he believed inhabited and shaped
                                nature's forms. His activity was not undisciplined; quite the opposite, he worked
                                diligently to perfect his craft.
                            </span>
                            <span>
                                Van Gogh hoped to attract like-minded painters to Arles, but only Gauguin joined him,
                                staying about two months. It was soon clear that their personalities and artistic
                                temperaments were incompatible, and Van Gogh suffered a breakdown just before Christmas.
                                In April, following periods of intense work interrupted by recurring mental
                                disturbances, Van Gogh committed himself to a sanitarium in St.-Rémy. He painted
                                whenever he could, believing that in work lay his only chance for sanity. After a year,
                                he returned north to be closer to his brother Théo, who had been his constant support;
                                in July he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
